This project is very helpful to get the color scheme for your own future projects and it is not the final version I'm looking forward to add other useful features to it and I hope you can tell me you opinions and ideas I can add to develop this amazing project üôè!

**Used technologies**
- HTML
- CSS(Media queries classes...)
- JS(Apis...)

**My newfound knowledge**
Apis applications, fetching data from them, turn it to Json and get data from it and also the ability to read apis documentation.

**What are the challenges**
Working with data that is fetched from the api and turning it show it to the user, this part is very important and needed more focus from me and effort and I learned many things at the end.
